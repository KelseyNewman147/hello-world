# hello-world


Hello, everyone!

My name is Kelsey and I am going to be learning how to code using Java and Clojure in a three month course at the Iron Yard.
My cohort starts in two weeks, and I am very anxious to start learning! In my spare time (what little of it I will have) I
plan to do yoga (probably) and hang out with my cat, Winston (AKA Winnie the Bish).
